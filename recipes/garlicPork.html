    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>When you're in need of a quick and easy dinner that the whole family will love, look no further than pork chops. This 5-star grilled pork chop recipe has reviewers' mouths watering thanks to the spectacular honey-garlic glaze — but the 25-minute fridge-to-table time is also a perk too.</p>
    <p>
      There might not be an actual award given to pork chops, but if there was, this 5-ingredient dish would surely win it thanks to the sauce alone. Reviewers rave about the ketchup, honey, soy sauce, and garlic glaze that is brushed onto the chops on the grill.
